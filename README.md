# Iris-Dataset-Visualisation and Prediction
My 1st DATASET - Iris Dataset Visualisation and Prediction
This is my first application of my Data Science Skills. I have used the IRIS Dataset to visualise the given datset, train and test the data and predict the species of a new data.
I hope I have done a good job,this being the first time for me.
I have used seaborn, matplotlib for Data Modelling.
For training, testing and prdeicting the accuracy, I have used a range of regressors and classifiers.
For predicting the species of unknown data, I have used K-Means Classifier.
I have also included the IRIS dataset in my repo.
